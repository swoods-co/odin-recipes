    </ul>
    <p>Servings: ~3 dozen</p>
    <p>This recipe is for a classic, unadorned latke; no kohlrabi or cumin here. Serve them hot and make more than you think you need. They go fast.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large Russet potatoes (about 1 pound), scrubbed and cut lengthwise into quarters</li>
        <li>1 large onion (8 ounces), peeled and cut into quarters</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>.5c all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2tsp coarse kosher salt (or 1tsp fine sea salt), plus more for sprinkling</li>
        <li>1tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>.5tsp freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>Safflower or other oil, for frying</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Using a food processor with a coarse grating disc, grate the potatoes and onion. Transfer the mixture to a clean dishtowel and squeeze and wring out as much of the liquid as possible.</li>
        <li>Working quickly, transfer the mixture to a large bowl. Add the eggs, flour, salt, baking powder and pepper, and mix until the flour is absorbed.</li>
        <li>n a medium heavy-bottomed pan over medium-high heat, pour in about Â¼ inch of the oil. Once the oil is hot (a drop of batter placed in the pan should sizzle), use a heaping tablespoon to drop the batter into the hot pan, cooking in batches. Use a spatula to flatten and shape the drops into discs. When the edges of the latkes are brown and crispy, about 5 minutes, flip. Cook until the second side is deeply browned, about another 5 minutes. Transfer the latkes to a paper towel-lined plate to drain and sprinkle with salt while still warm. Repeat with the remaining batter.</li>
    </ol>
